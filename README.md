# Machine-Learning

The folder handin-1 contain codes (in python) and the result folder. Here I built optical character recognition using logistic regression and softmax. The classifier takes images of numbers as input and output which number the image represent. Both of my implementations gave a test accuracy of 89%

The folder handin-2 builds more complicated classifiers with SVM and neural network. "nn_model.py" implements a standard feed forward neural nets with one hidden layer. Whereas, cnn_model.py improved optical character recognition using convolutional net. 

The folder handin-3 contains java code for hidden markov model. I made a 19 state HMM to annotate the genome as non-coding(N), coding (C) or Reversed coding region (R). I trained the model using training by counting with psuedocounts and then used vitervi decoding to annotated unknown genomes. The transition diagram is also present in the folder.

The folder handin-4 contains clustering algorithms (Llyod's algorithm and expectation maximization).
